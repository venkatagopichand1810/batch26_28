to maintain the state of the application 
1) usestate: if we wanted to maintain the simple state of the application we have used usestate hook
2) useReducer: if we wanted to maintain the complex state of the application we have used useReducer hook

3) if we wanted to maintain the complex state of the application and we wanted to share that state with multiple components we have to use redux

redux is not from the react, but it is the third party library

Redux helps to manage the global state of the application, instead of passing the props from one component to another component

Redux solve the follwing things
1) one central store of the state
2) any component can access or udpate the state withtout passing the props
3) any component can subscribe to the state changes


1) actions: actions are the plain javascript objects that describes the payload of information that is sent from your application to the redux store

const increment = "increment";

2) reducers: reducers are the pure functions that takes the previous state and action and returns the next state

reduces it is going to check the prev statte and based on the action type it is going to give the updated new state

counter = 0; 

const reducer = (1, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "increment":
            return state + 1; -> 2
        default:
            return state;
    }
}


3) store: store is the object that holds the application state and provides a few helper methods to access the state, dispatch actions and register listeners

store is the central place 
1) holds the current state
2) dispatch the actions
3) it is going to nofity the components when the state changes
