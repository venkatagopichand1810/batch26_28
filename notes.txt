1.	Can I update the _id of an existing document? If yes, how does the index behave?
If no, why not? What if I use aggregation update?
2.	If two documents don’t have the same fields, how does MongoDB compare them during sorting?
3.	Why does MongoDB treat _id: "10" and _id: 10 as different?
Shouldn’t NoSQL be flexible with types?
4.	If Express uses middleware, what happens internally when I call next()? Who calls what?
5.	What is the difference between req.query, req.params, and req.body? Why do we need 3 different places just to get inputs?
6.	Can I run two Express servers on the same port if I use two different routes?
7.	If JWT is signed, why can’t we just encrypt it and skip signing
8.	Why do we keep the JWT secret on the server if the client already has the token?
9.	If JWT expires in 15 minutes, how do we stay logged in for hours without typing password again?
